Facial Recognition Attendance System

This is a Python-based desktop application that automates student attendance using facial recognition. It is built using Python, OpenCV, face_recognition, Tkinter, SQLite, and Pandas. The system allows students to register their faces via webcam or image upload, and it detects faces in real-time using the webcam. Attendance is stored in an SQLite database, and faculty can log in to view records or export them as CSV files.

How to Run:

1. Install the required libraries using this command:
pip install opencv-python face_recognition numpy pandas pillow

2. Run the application:
python test-1.py
